# About brickbybits

Project for [2025 NASA Space Apps Haackathon](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/local-events/dubai/), held at University of Dubai, 3-4 October, 2025

## About the Team 
[We are a team](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/find-a-team/nextbyte/) that's passionate about building the next generation of healthy, sustainable cities, combining data science, machine learning, and sustainable urban development to create innovative solutions that balance environmental health, societal progress and human well-being.


## Project Summary
Our project, [Brick by Bits](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/find-a-team/nextbyte/?tab=project), is a projection model designed for urban planners, especially in the UAE. By using climate, weather, and population density datasets, along with a platform for user input on local issues, the tool allows urban planners to plan any developmentrs in certain areas to help meet the needs of the residents near there as well as to adapt to the conditions shown through the map. By streamlining how public feedback and environmental data inform urban planning, Brick by Bits ensures that development is both sustainable and socially inclusive, helping cities grow smarter, fairer, and more resilient to climate challenges.
